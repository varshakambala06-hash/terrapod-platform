# Terrapod Development Roadmap

## Phase 1 – Prototype Validation (Tranche 1)
Duration: 8–10 weeks

Deliverables:
- Functional Terrapod hardware prototype
- Integration of soil sensors (moisture, temperature)
- Initial organic carbon estimation logic
- Rule-based AI recommendation engine
- Pilot testing with limited devices
- Data logging and validation

Milestone Outcome:
- TRL-4 → TRL-5
- Ready for multi-device pilot deployment

## Phase 2 – Pilot & Scale (Tranche 2)
Deliverables:
- Improved sensor calibration
- ML-based nutrient models
- Mobile app dashboard
- Deployment of 50+ Terrapods
- Farmer feedback and iteration
